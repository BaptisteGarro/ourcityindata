## Setting up the virtual environment
To make sure we use the same packages, you should create a virtual environment. Open a terminal, go to the root directory of this repository (OURCITYINDATA) and run

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment in the terminal with (for Windows)
```
venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```
For other operating systems, you can find the commands [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Then you can install the required packages with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you should be able to run the code in this repository.
